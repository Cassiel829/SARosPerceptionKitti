- [] better bounding box fitter
- [] implement better gronud estimation/investigate bad occupancy grid
- [] init orientation better
- [] upload them
- [] unify sensor parameters
- [] script to download files
- [] post data and benchmarking
- [] investigate benchmark stability
- [] save image results and txt results + parameters used
- [] integrate mask rcnn
- [] think of better way to trigger ground truth
- [] add bounding box to object message
- [] add ground truth image
- [] change detection list to be no class member like in tracking
- [] add stereo SGBM

- [] move tracking velocity arrow to roof height
- [] restructure package into
	- [] sensors
	- [] detection
	- [] tracking
	- [] evaluation
	- [] util
- [] add tracing

- [] video tutorial of all components
- [] release a video each week
- [] gather more scenarios and write docu for it
